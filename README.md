# EEG_Freewill_reaching_grasping_load_data

Dataset description:

Experiment paradigms:

Subjects perform a free-reaching and grasping task at any time within 12 s (trial) using only their right hand. IN each trail, the subject performs reaching ads grasping one of the 4 cups with their own will. Each trial begins with the audio cue "start", and the subject performs reaching ads grasping one of the 4 cups with their own will. After a trial ends, a 7-s break starts with an "end"  audio cue, during which the subject returns the selected cup to its original place. 

In the experiment,  each subject completed multiple recordings on different days. Each recording has several sessions, and each session contains multiple trials. 

Subjects: 23 healthy right-handed adults. 

Sampling rate = 1000 Hz for subjects LLE031 and OQEO73 and 250 Hz for the remaining 21 subjects. 

Channels:
  - 31 EEG channels, with Cz as the reference and GND as the ground, 
  - 4 EOG channels
  - 1 audio channel
  - 3 accelerometer signals
